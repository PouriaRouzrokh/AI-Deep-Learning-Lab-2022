# Contributing Guidelines for Presenters

Detailed instructions for contributing were sent out in an email to course faculty.

Please add any files required for your session to the appropriate subdirectory of `sessions`. E.g. if you're uploading files for the **CT Body Part Classification** session, you should add them to the folder `sessions/ct-body-part`.

If you need storage for large files (>100 MB per file) such as model weights, please email Walter Wiggins at [walter.wiggins@duke.edu](mailto:walter.wiggins@duke.edu).

> Please ensure you have a preliminary version of your Colab notebook submitted to this repository by **November 23, 2022**.
