Through further examination of the data we see that some reports (e.g. id 68) only have an impression section but no findings section. THere are also numerous XXXX in reports which likely represent placeholder text after PHI removal (names, dates, etc). Even for normal labeled reports, there is quite a large amount of variation in the text of the reports."

        "\n",
        "Word (or text) normalization is reducing text to a standardized form before processing. One way to do this is word stemming and/or lemmatization. In word stemming, the suffix of a word is removed, often leaving behind a stem that is not a full word. In lemmatization, words are transformed into a base word. For example, it is common to remove verb conjugations to reduce different forms of a verb to a single word/token - transforming flying, flown, flew -> fly. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will introduce the concept here, but it will not be included within the preprocessing pipeline. Medical stemming is a difficult topic due to many words sharing roots while still having different meanings (e.g. pneumonia, pneumonitis, pneumonic, pneumothorax). Most available stemming packages are not designed for medical stemming and could introduce problems by truncating useful parts of words (\"over stemming\"). \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to stemming/lemmatizing words which are based on word roots, one can normalize words by mapping words to a controlled vocabulary. This is especially useful in medicine where a number of terms could refer to the same entity (e.g. hepatorenal recess vs subhepatic recess vs pouch of Morison vs Morison's pouch). Examples of efforts to create standardized medical vocabulary include [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), [SNOMED-CT](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/index.html), and [RadLex](http://radlex.org/)"

In this example, a \"positive\" label by the model is the equivalent of flagging an example as \"abnormal\".\n",
